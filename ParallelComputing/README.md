This repository contains some parallel computing practices. 
The pi calculus using leipniz formula and POSFIX threads, the application of a sobel filter to an image using the STB_Image library, POSFIX, OpenMP threads and OpenMPI processes parallelization and the application of a sobel filter to an image using the LodePNG library and CUDA thread parallelization.
